# Reflection of Major Project

# Advice if I were to make a similar project again

- have a clearer vision in mind
- don't procrastinate

# Needs to have completion

Completed everything in "needs to have" list. Some things were more difficult to complete than others, especially the enemies for some reason.
Had time to add a few easy "nice to haves" as well. Little things like sound effects and character selection. Would've liked to add moving/breaking platforms but too tired.

# Most difficulty

Getting the enemy to work how I want
- first I wanted to use a class
- then I tried p5ply
- tried class again
- went back to p5play
- settled on p5play
- enemies still don't move how I wanted but it works  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Anything unsolved

I still would like to have the enemies flip to face the direction they're going but for some reason the movement sequencing in p5play doesnt allow it
- tried making a separate function to put into the sequencing but it won't work
- tried putting enemies.mirror.x directly into the sequence but still doesn'y work
