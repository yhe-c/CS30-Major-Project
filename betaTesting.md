Well done. 
- The game was fun and panic inducing
- Some of the backgrounds are distracting/make things hard to see
- Code is nice and neat.

(Non-CS , likes gaming tho)
Could try to fix the character bouncing. The wall jumping kind of adds a cool speedrun element to the game. If you can remember where the portals are you can complete the game very quickly without getting the wards. The backgrounds sometimes makes things hard to see; wards blend into the background, portals are colored black so it blends in very easily. The gameover sound effect can be switched for something more scary, the one in the beta test sounds more like a power up than the character dying. Maybe add a game win sound.
